Send e-mail from your console!

ConsoleMail enables you to easily send quick emails from your console using GMail.
Simply configure the ```sendemailfrom``` environment variable with a GMail account email address you would like to send emails from.
Then, configure the ```sendemailpassword``` variable with that email account's password.

Once that is complete, the ```ConsoleMail.exe``` application can be opened, and used to send quick and easy emails.
To get the most out of this application, it is strongly recommended that you add the application's location to your ```PATH``` environment variable, so that it can easily be used as a console command, no matter what directory your console is currently browsing in.
